# Android app removal 

The Pebble app was removed from the Google Play Store due to SMS issues ([Read about it here.](/android-app-unavailable))

If you do not have the Pebble app installed, check out [the guide for installing it](/sideload-android-app).


# Connect your Pebble to its charger

Connect your Pebble to a plugged-in USB charging cable. You really wouldn't want it to lose power in the middle of a firmware update! Once the watch is powered on, press the left button to dismiss the charging screen.


# Open the Pebble app

You will be greeted by the Pebble Account page. Simply tap 'SKIP LOGIN' twice to continue.

# Choose the type of Pebble you have

# Pair your watch

The app starts looking for nearby Pebbles. It should shortly see your Pebble as "Pebble xxxx", which can be also seen on the Pebble, so you can confirm that the phone is seeing the right watch. Tap it.   

If your phone does not see the Pebble, try these steps:
1. Turn on Airplane mode on your phone
2. Turn on Location (this is how Pebble looks for nearby Bluetooth devices)
3. Turn on Bluetooth
4. Pair the Pebble through the Pebble app. (Make sure to turn off Airplane Mode afterwards!)

If that still doesn't work, please [contact us on Discord!](/discord)

# Run through the watch setup

Run through the Pebble setup screens. Make sure you allow notification access:

<sub>Please note you might have to enable [restricted settings](https://help.rebble.io/android-restricted-settings) on Android 13+ </sub>




# Complete the Pebble pairing

Once you get to this screen, you've successfully connected your Pebble! 

All that's left to do now is to connect it to Rebble Web Services.

# Visit boot.rebble.io

The boot process, or 'running boot', is the process in which you tell the Pebble app to use Rebble servers instead of the defunct Pebble servers.   

On your phone, open a decent browser (like Chrome or Firefox), and go to [boot.rebble.io](https://boot.rebble.io)

<notmobile>
    <qr url="https://boot.rebble.io" />
</notmobile>

If you are not already logged in, you will be greeted with a number of ways to sign in.   

Choose one and sign in. 

*Remember your sign in credentials!*

# Press 'Switch to Rebble'

You should now be seeing a page titled "Here we go!"

Read the page, then tap the **Switch to Rebble** button at the bottom of the page.   

If you get a prompt about "Open with Pebble", press 'Okay'.

The Pebble app will then open.

# All done!

**If you get back to the Pebble app and don't see that screen (e.g. you see the login screen again), go back to the browser and press *Switch to Rebble* again.**

Press the "It's Rebble time!" button.

# What's next?

Congratulations! Now what can you do with your Pebble?

Tap the big “+” in the lower right corner to find and install watchfaces you like from the Rebble appstore.

If you want to use dictation, get weather pins in your Timeline, and have a faster Timeline sync period (and generally support the people who make Rebble possible), consider a [Rebble subscription](/subscription).

If you have any other questions, [contact us on Discord!](/discord)

## Welcome to *Rebbled* Pebble!
