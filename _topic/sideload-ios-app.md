# Installing the Pebble app on iOS with Sideloadly

---------------------------------------------------------

The Pebble app is [no longer on the App Store](/ios-app-unavailable).   
No worries! If you have a Apple ID, you can install the 
app yourself! Just be aware that you have to do this
every week in order for the app to keep running.

If you install the app and don't redo the process after a week,
your Pebble will still receive notifications.

## What we are going to do:
1. Install Sideloadly on computer.
2. Use Sideloadly to sideload the Pebble IPA file onto the iOS device.

## Requirements:
- Computer (Windows 10 or MacOS 10.14 and higher)
- iOS device (iOS 7+)
- Cable for iOS device
- (Optional) Latest iCloud and iTunes installed
- Apple ID (account)

## Before starting:
- Make sure the iOS device is connected to the internet.
- Make sure the iOS device is not connected to the computer until mentioned.
- If you have iPhone 5 or earlier, download the 32-bit IPA in the links at the bottom of this guide
- If you have iPhone 5S or newer, download the 64-bit IPA in the links at the bottom of this guide

## Installation:
1. Download the appropiate Pebble IPA on your computer (See links below).
2. Download and install Sideloadly on your computer (See links below).
3. Connect your iOS device. (There may be a popup on the iOS device asking if you want to trust the computer, press Allow)
4. Run Sideloadly. At some point there will be a popup that asks for your Apple ID. Enter your email and password.
> INFO: Depending on your device, you may need to go into Advanced Options and tick the appropriate boxes.
5. Click on the IPA icon. Select the Pebble IPA you downloaded in step #1. Press "Start". 
> INFO: Make sure your device is showing in the dropdown list named "iDevice" before attempting!
6. The Pebble app is now installed. If a "Untrusted Developer" pops up, simply go to the Settings app > General > Device Management > (your Apple ID email) and click on  "Trust (your apple ID email)" The Pebble app should now have a "Verified" on that same settings page.
7. Go to the rebble website and create a rebble account (or sign in if you already have one).
8. Click the "Switch to Rebble" button 
9. Redo steps 3-6 every week.
10. Profit!

## Help:
- If you're getting sideloading issues, try installing the latest iTunes and iCloud before you start the process. 
> For Windows users: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MICROSOFT STORE VERSION. Get it from Apple's website.
- If Sideloadly doesn't work for you (as some people have reported)
- If the app doesn't start, go to the Settings app > General > Device Management > (your Apple ID email). The Pebble app should have the "Verified" status. If not, repeat steps 3-6.
> If there are any problems that this guide can't solve, please join the Rebble Discord server (link at the bottom of guide) and ask in the #rebble-help channel; one of the helpful volunteers will be glad to help you out!
