# Connect your Pebble to its charger   

Connect your Pebble to a plugged in USB charging cable. You really wouldn't want it to lose power in the middle of a firmware update! Once the watch is powered on, press the left button to dismiss the charging screen.

# Install the app from the App Store

On your iPhone, download the Pebble app from the App Store:

[App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/pebble/id957997620?mt=8)

<notmobile>

or via this QR code:

# Open the Pebble app

If prompted, allow the Pebble app to turn on Bluetooth.

All that's left to do now is set the location permission and connect it to Rebble Web Services.

# Allow location

Open your iPhone's settings and look for "Privacy." Then, open the "Location Services" section.

A list of your apps should load. Find the Pebble app here.

Set the location permission to 'Always'. This is required for things like watchface weather.

**Wait at least fifteen seconds** before proceeding to the next step.

You’re done! Tap the big “+” in the lower right corner and find and install watchfaces you like from the Rebble appstore.
