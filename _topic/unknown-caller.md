# Incoming calls are displayed as “Unknown caller”

If you are using the Pebble app with Android 9 or later, you might have trouble with caller ID.

The solution is to install [Dialer for Pebble](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/532323bf60c773c1420000a8), and the associated [companion app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matejdro.pebbledialer).

Make sure you the disable notifications for phone calls in the pebble app:
